    "# Building a Self-Hosted VPN IP Rotation System (Free Tier) #\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Create a VPN-based system that **rotates your public IP address** after a set number of requests (e.g. every 100 requests) for fun and learning. We will avoid paid services and use only free-tier resources. The IP addresses will come from **free democracies** (United States, Canada, EU countries, Australia, Japan). Everything is self-hosted with free-tier cloud servers, and we’ll use **Python** to control the rotation logic. This setup is ideal for testing scenarios like web scraping or geo-location testing where frequent IP changes are useful, all while keeping costs near zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of the System ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Our rotating VPN system consists of several components working together:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multiple VPN Servers (Self-Hosted):** We will deploy lightweight VPN servers (e.g. WireGuard or OpenVPN) on free-tier cloud instances in different regions (US, Canada, EU, Australia, Japan). Each server provides a different outbound IP address. By hosting our own, we ensure no third-party VPN service is needed and we control any logging (for privacy).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pool of Free-Tier IP Addresses:** Using free cloud resources, we’ll maintain a **pool of IP addresses** from the target regions. For example, an AWS free-tier VM in the US, an Oracle Cloud free-tier VM in Europe, etc. These serve as our rotating VPN endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python Rotation Controller:** A Python script on the client side will count outgoing requests and **trigger the VPN to switch** to a new server after *N* requests (e.g. 100). This script manages the VPN connections (connecting/disconnecting to the various VPN servers as needed). \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Client Configuration & Management:** A simple configuration (or management interface) to list available VPN servers and set rotation rules (like the number of requests before switching). This makes it easy to add/remove servers or change the rotation interval without altering code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Monitoring & Logging:** Logging will be implemented to track how many requests have been sent, which IP is currently in use, and when rotations happen. Basic monitoring will ensure the VPN tunnel is active and help troubleshoot issues. This way you can **track VPN status and request counts** in real-time for learning and debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works (big picture):** Initially, the system connects to VPN Server A (say, in the US). All outbound requests (e.g. web requests from a Python script or browser if system-wide VPN) will exit with Server A’s IP. The Python controller counts requests; when 100 requests have been made, it disconnects from Server A and connects to VPN Server B (say, in Europe). Now traffic exits with Server B’s IP. After another 100 requests, it switches to Server C (e.g. Japan), and so on, cycling through the pool. This **IP address rotation** (changing the IP after a certain number of requests) helps keep your activity anonymous and avoid IP-based blocking ([What is a rotating IP address? | NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/blog/what-is-ip-rotation/#:~:text=IP%20address%20rotation%20is%20a,blocking%2C%20or%20balance%20network%20traffic)). By using servers in democratic countries, we ensure the IPs are from those regions (and likely not subject to strict censorship or throttling).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choosing Free-Tier Servers in Target Regions ##\n",
    "\n",
    "To get IP addresses in target regions without cost, we leverage the **free-tier offerings of cloud providers**. Below are specific free-tier hosting options that can provide servers (with public IPs) in the US, Canada, EU, Australia, and Japan:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Amazon Web Services (AWS) Free Tier:** AWS offers 12 months of free usage for a t2.micro VM (750 hours per month) on new accounts ([Setup a Free VPN Service on AWS with OpenVPN | Analytics Vidhya](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/setup-a-free-vpn-service-on-aws-613fcec6e7c6#:~:text=,running%20the%20VPN%20on%20AWS)). AWS has data centers around the world (26 regions) ([6 Best Free VPS Hosting Providers (2025)｜Cloud Service Providers Free Tier Overview | 1 Dollar VPS](https://onedollarvps.com/blogs/6-best-free-vps-hosting-providers#:~:text=Image%3A%20Amazon%20Web%20Services%20,Linux%2060%20Visit)), including North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific (Japan, Australia), etc. This means user can launch a free-tier EC2 instance in (for example) **US-East (N. Virginia)**, **Canada (Montreal)**, **EU (Frankfurt)**, **Asia-Pacific (Tokyo)**, etc. under the same account. *Note:* 750 hours/month is enough for one instance running full-time; if you run multiple instances simultaneously, the hours are cumulative. User can still rotate between regions by running one VM at a time or carefully splitting hours. AWS recently also increased the free outbound data transfer to **100 GB per month** for free-tier users ([AWS Free Tier Data Transfer Expansion – 100 GB From Regions ...](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-free-tier-data-transfer-expansion-100-gb-from-regions-and-1-tb-from-amazon-cloudfront-per-month/#:~:text=,from%201%20GB%20per%20region)), which is plenty for testing traffic. This makes AWS a great option to get several global IPs within free limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Oracle Cloud Always Free:** Oracle’s cloud has an **Always Free** tier (no time limit) that includes up to **2 free VM instances** (1 CPU, 1 GB RAM each) in user selected home region ([GitHub - cloudcommunity/Cloud-Free-Tier-Comparison: Comparing the free tier offers of the major cloud providers like AWS, Azure, GCP, Oracle etc.](https://github.com/cloudcommunity/Cloud-Free-Tier-Comparison#:~:text=%2A%20Compute%3A%20%28Note,data%20egress%2Fmonth%20per%20originating%20region)). User can pick a home region such as the **US**, **UK/Germany (EU)**, **Japan**, **Australia**, or **Canada** (Oracle has many region options). Those VMs come with free public IPs and a very generous **10 TB/month of egress data** included ([GitHub - cloudcommunity/Cloud-Free-Tier-Comparison: Comparing the free tier offers of the major cloud providers like AWS, Azure, GCP, Oracle etc.](https://github.com/cloudcommunity/Cloud-Free-Tier-Comparison#:~:text=%2A%204%20Arm,5%20OCI%20Bastions)), so won’t likely hit bandwidth limits. The catch is all free VMs must be in the one region you select for your account. For our purposes, you might create one Oracle account with home region in Europe (to get an EU IP) or another in Japan, etc., if user wanted multiple always-free servers (this would require separate accounts since one account = one region’s free VMs). Even with one account, Oracle’s free tier could provide *two* VPN servers in the same region for redundancy or testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Free Tier:** GCP’s always-free tier provides one small e2-micro VM instance (≈0.25 vCPU, 1 GB RAM) **per month**, but **only in certain US regions** (Iowa, Oregon, South Carolina) ([GitHub - cloudcommunity/Cloud-Free-Tier-Comparison: Comparing the free tier offers of the major cloud providers like AWS, Azure, GCP, Oracle etc.](https://github.com/cloudcommunity/Cloud-Free-Tier-Comparison#:~:text=Always%20Free)). This is great for a **US-based IP**. GCP’s free tier has limited outbound data (1 GB/month on premium network, or up to 200 GB on lower-tier network) ([GitHub - cloudcommunity/Cloud-Free-Tier-Comparison: Comparing the free tier offers of the major cloud providers like AWS, Azure, GCP, Oracle etc.](https://github.com/cloudcommunity/Cloud-Free-Tier-Comparison#:~:text=,east1)), so it’s best for light use. If user specifically needs an IP in the US, you can use GCP’s free VM. (For Europe or Asia, GCP would require using the free trial credit, which is time-limited, so it's prefered other providers for non-US regions.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Microsoft Azure Free Account:** Azure offers **12 months free** of a B1S VM (1 vCPU, 1 GB) for new users (750 hours/month) ([Azure Free Tier - Microsoft Q&A](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1191439/azure-free-tier#:~:text=Azure%20Free%20Tier%20,days%20you%20have%20%24200%20credit)) ([Azure B1 virtual machines time limit and conditions - Microsoft Q&A](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1218980/azure-b1-virtual-machines-time-limit-and-condition#:~:text=Q%26A%20learn,up%20to%20750%20hours)). Also get $200 credit for the first 30 days. Azure has regions in **US, Canada, Europe, Australia, Japan** and more. Could use an Azure free VM in, say, Canada or Australia to cover a region that AWS/GCP Oracle free tiers might not concurrently cover. (Azure’s free VM is similar to AWS’s – one free Linux VM running at a time for a year.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Other Options:** Some cloud/VPS providers have free trials or community free tiers:\n",
    "    - **DigitalOcean** gives new users credit (e.g. $100 for 60 days) which could launch VMs in datacenters like New York, London, Frankfurt, etc. (temporary but useful for experiment).\n",
    "    - **Vultr** has occasionally a free trial program (needs application) with many global locations ([6 Best Free VPS Hosting Providers (2025)｜Cloud Service Providers Free Tier Overview | 1 Dollar VPS](https://onedollarvps.com/blogs/6-best-free-vps-hosting-providers#:~:text=VultrBest%20VPS%20hosting%20Fill%20out,Bahrain%2C%20Oman%2C%20Kuwait%2C%20Japan%2C%20Singapore)).\n",
    "    - **IBM Cloud Lite** account can create a small free instance (with low RAM) in certain regions, though it may have restrictions.\n",
    "    - **LightNode** and other smaller providers sometimes advertise “always free” micro instances in various countries ([6 Best Free VPS Hosting Providers (2025)｜Cloud Service Providers Free Tier Overview | 1 Dollar VPS](https://onedollarvps.com/blogs/6-best-free-vps-hosting-providers#:~:text=Image%3A%201%20dollar%20VPS%20LightNode,Credit%20Free%20for%2060%20days)), but be cautious and check their terms.\n",
    "    - You can also repurpose **old hardware or a Raspberry Pi at home** as a VPN server, but that will give your home’s IP (not in all those countries), so it’s less useful for multi-country rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a combination of the above, you can assemble a **pool of VPN servers** in the target regions all within free allowances. For example, user might deploy:\n",
    "- **Server A:** AWS free-tier EC2 in **US-East** (Virginia) – IP in USA ([Setup a Free VPN Service on AWS with OpenVPN | Analytics Vidhya](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/setup-a-free-vpn-service-on-aws-613fcec6e7c6#:~:text=,running%20the%20VPN%20on%20AWS)).\n",
    "- **Server B:** Oracle Cloud free VM in **Frankfurt** – IP in Germany (EU).\n",
    "- **Server C:** Azure free VM in **Japan East (Tokyo)** – IP in Japan.\n",
    "- **Server D:** AWS (same account or another) in **Australia (Sydney)** – IP in Australia.\n",
    "- **Server E:** Oracle Cloud (separate account) in **Canada** – IP in Canada.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is just an example setup; even 2–3 servers can be enough to experiment. The key is that **each server has its own public IP** in a desired country. All these servers will run a VPN service (OpenVPN, WireGuard, or SoftEther) so that you can connect to them remotely.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Normally, hosting servers in many regions could be expensive, as one would need to pay for each server. We mitigate that by using free-tier resources. As one source points out, having many VPN exit points means hosting many servers, which “can get expensive” ([Setup a Free VPN Service on AWS with OpenVPN | Analytics Vidhya](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/setup-a-free-vpn-service-on-aws-613fcec6e7c6#:~:text=You%20can%20host%20OpenVPN%20in,AWS)) – but by sticking to free tiers and modest usage, we avoid charges. Always monitor your free-tier usage (hours and bandwidth) to stay within limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing and Configuring VPN Servers (OpenVPN/WireGuard) ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we set up a VPN server on each cloud instance. You can choose **OpenVPN, WireGuard, or SoftEther** – all can work. We’ll focus on a lightweight approach with **WireGuard** (which is fast and easy to configure), but note where OpenVPN or SoftEther could be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Basic Setup Steps for Each Server:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **Deploy the VM:** After launching the free-tier VM (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is a good choice for simplicity), make sure it has a public IP and that you have SSH access. In the cloud provider’s security settings, open the VPN port (e.g. UDP **51820** for WireGuard, or UDP **1194** for OpenVPN). Also allow SSH (port 22) for management. For example, in AWS’s Security Group, add a rule for UDP 51820 from your IP, and in Oracle’s cloud, enable the ingress rule for your VM.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. **Install VPN Software:** \n",
    "     - *WireGuard:* Install WireGuard using the OS package manager (e.g. on Ubuntu: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install wireguard`). This installs the `wg` and `wg-quick` tools and sets up needed kernel modules.\n",
    "     - *OpenVPN:* Install OpenVPN (`sudo apt install openvpn easy-rsa` on Ubuntu) or use a script like the openvpn-install for easy setup. Alternatively, use the OpenVPN Access Server (as in AWS Marketplace) if you prefer a web UI (but that can be heavier).\n",
    "     - *SoftEther:* Download and install SoftEther VPN Server. This provides a GUI/CLI to configure L2TP, OpenVPN emulation, etc. SoftEther is flexible but will use more memory/CPU on the instance. For a micro VM, WireGuard or OpenVPN is usually sufficient and simpler.\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. **Configure the VPN Server:** We need to configure each server to accept a VPN client connection and forward traffic:\n",
    "     - **WireGuard Configuration:** Generate a key pair for the server and one for the client. For example on the server:\n",
    "       ```bash\n",
    "       wg genkey | tee server_private.key | wg pubkey > server_public.key\n",
    "       wg genkey | tee client_private.key | wg pubkey > client_public.key\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "       This gives user a server private/public key and a client private/public key. Then create the WireGuard config file (e.g. `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`) with something like:\n",
    "       ```ini\n",
    "       [Interface]\n",
    "       Address = 10.0.0.1/24\n",
    "       PrivateKey = <SERVER_PRIVATE_KEY>\n",
    "       ListenPort = 51820\n",
    "\n",
    "       # Enable IP forwarding on the server (can also do this in sysctl)\n",
    "       PostUp   = sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE\n",
    "       PostDown = iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE\n",
    "\n",
    "       [Peer]\n",
    "       PublicKey = <CLIENT_PUBLIC_KEY>\n",
    "       AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.2/32\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "       In this config, the server is set to IP 10.0.0.1 in a VPN subnet, listens on UDP 51820. The `PostUp` line enables IP forwarding and sets up NAT (so traffic from VPN is masqueraded out via the server’s internet interface `eth0`). This NAT step is crucial for the VPN to route client traffic to the internet. The Peer section authorizes one client (with the client’s public key) and allows it the IP 10.0.0.2. Save this and bring up WireGuard: `sudo wg-quick up wg0`. The server is now ready.\n",
    "     - **Client Config for WireGuard:** On one's local machine (the client), one will use the corresponding client config:\n",
    "       ```ini\n",
    "       [Interface]\n",
    "       PrivateKey = <CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY>\n",
    "       Address = 10.0.0.2/24\n",
    "       DNS = 1.1.1.1   # (use a public DNS resolver when on VPN)\n",
    "\n",
    "       [Peer]\n",
    "       PublicKey = <SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY>\n",
    "       Endpoint = <SERVER_PUBLIC_IP>:51820\n",
    "       AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "       This client config assigns your VPN interface the IP 10.0.0.2 and sets DNS. The peer is the server’s public key and endpoint (e.g. `ec2-3-XX-XX-XX.compute-1.amazonaws.com:51820`). `AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0` means all traffic goes through the VPN tunnel (full tunnel mode). In WireGuard, no username/password is needed – the keys authenticate the connection. User can save this as `wg0-client.conf` and use it to connect (more on that below). Repeat similar steps for each server (each will have its own IP subnet and keys, or you can reuse the client key on all servers for simplicity – but using separate keys per server/client pair is more secure).\n",
    "\n",
    "     - **OpenVPN Configuration (alternative):** If using OpenVPN, one would generate server and client certificates (using EasyRSA), configure the server `server.conf` (specifying `push \"redirect-gateway def1\"` to route all client traffic, and setting up NAT with iptables, plus pushing DNS). Many tutorials exist for this. Once OpenVPN is set up, you’d have a `.ovpn` client file for each server. The principle is similar: each server will have an OpenVPN listening (TCP or UDP on a port), and the client config file when used will route all traffic through that tunnel.\n",
    "\n",
    "     - **SoftEther (alternative):** SoftEther can be configured via the VPN Server Manager to create a “Virtual Hub” for the VPN, enable SecureNAT or configure local bridging for internet access, and users. It even can emulate an OpenVPN server and give you an OVPN config. SoftEther might be overkill for simple rotation, but it’s an option if user wants to experiment with multiple protocols (e.g., connect via OpenVPN protocol to one, SSTP to another, etc., from the same SoftEther server).\n",
    "\n",
    "  4. **Test Each VPN Server:** Before automating rotation,  required to test that can connect to each VPN server individually:\n",
    "     - For WireGuard: use the client config on a local machine. If on Linux, you can do `sudo wg-quick up wg0-client.conf` (after installing the wireguard tools locally). On Windows or Mac, one would import the config into the WireGuard app. Once connected, verify all internet through the VPN: for example, run `curl ifconfig.me` and see that it returns the server’s IP address, not your home IP.\n",
    "     - For OpenVPN: launch the `.ovpn` profile using the OpenVPN client (or `openvpn --config client.ovpn` on Linux). Similarly verify the external IP.\n",
    "     - If one can browse or curl and see the public IP as the server’s IP, that VPN is working. If not, check firewall and that IP forwarding/NAT is enabled on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asure all VPN servers are up and accessible. Now you have a **pool of VPN endpoints**, each with a known region IP. (For example: Server A – 203.0.113.x in US, Server B – 198.51.100.x in Germany, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python-Based IP Rotation Logic ##\n",
    "\n",
    "With the servers in place, the next component is the **Python script that manages rotating the VPN connections**. The script’s responsibilities are:\n",
    "- Keep track of how many requests have been made through the VPN.\n",
    "- After *N* requests (e.g. 100), disconnect the current VPN and connect to the next one in the pool.\n",
    "- Provide an easy way to specify the rotation interval and which VPNs to cycle through.\n",
    "- Log actions and handle basic errors (e.g. if a VPN server is down, skip to the next).\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to route requests via the VPN:** The simplest approach is to have the Python script manage the VPN connection at the operating system level. For instance, if using WireGuard, the script can call `wg-quick up` or `down` to start/stop the tunnel. When the tunnel is up, all system traffic (including Python’s `requests` or your browser if system-wide) will go through the VPN. Alternatively, you could run your Python script within the tunnel network namespace, but controlling the system VPN is easier for a learning scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rotation strategy:** We will maintain a list of VPN configs and cycle through them. For example, `vpn_configs = [\"wg-us.conf\", \"wg-eu.conf\", \"wg-jp.conf\"]` corresponding to our servers. We also set a threshold N = 100 (requests). We connect to vpn_configs[0], run 100 requests, then switch to vpn_configs[1], etc. The rotation can be round-robin.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementing the counter and switch:** One can use Python’s `requests` library for making web requests (for example, scraping websites or calling APIs). After each request, increment a counter. When the counter reaches N, trigger the switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a simplified **example Python pseudocode** for the rotation controller. This assumes we are making HTTP requests and want to rotate IPs periodically:\n",
    "\n",

    "        print(f\"Switched to VPN {vpn_configs[current_index]}, new IP: {my_ip}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this script:\n",
    "- We use `subprocess.run` to call system commands for bringing the VPN up or down. (For OpenVPN, you might start it as a background process instead, and kill it on rotation.)\n",
    "- We loop through a list of URLs (here just using example.com multiple times as a stand-in for multiple requests). After each request, increment `request_count`.\n",
    "- When `request_count` hits `max_requests` (100), we disconnect the current VPN and connect the next one. We then reset the counter.\n",
    "- We also print out (and could log) the new IP after switching by querying an external service (`api.ipify.org` returns your public IP as plain text). This is a sanity check to confirm the IP really changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect is that every 100 requests, the script rotates through `wg-us.conf` → `wg-eu.conf` → `wg-jp.conf` and back to `wg-us.conf`, and so on. This realizes the “rotate IP after N requests” behavior: *“IP address rotation is a process where one's IP…changes…after a certain amount of requests…to avoid IP blocking”* ([What is a rotating IP address? | NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/blog/what-is-ip-rotation/#:~:text=IP%20address%20rotation%20is%20a,blocking%2C%20or%20balance%20network%20traffic)). Each WireGuard config corresponds to one of our VPN servers in a different region, so we are effectively hopping between countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Client management and configuration:** To make this flexible:\n",
    "- We can store the list of VPN endpoints and `max_requests` in a configuration file (e.g., a JSON or YAML file). The Python script can read this at startup. For example, `config.json` could contain:\n",
    "  ```json\n",
    "  {\n",

    "  This way, one can add or remove servers, or change the rotation interval, by editing the file without touching the code. The script would parse this and populate `vpn_configs` list and `max_requests` value accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- User might also implement a simple command-line argument for `max_requests` so you can override it when running the script. For instance, using Python’s argparse to allow `--max 50` to set 50 requests before rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If one wants to get fancy, a *basic UI* could be added. For example, a small web dashboard (using Flask) or a simple text menu in the console to list current servers, add a new one, or change N. This is optional but could be a fun extension for learning. In most cases, editing the config file or code is fine for a personal project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Switching logic considerations:** The example above rotates in a fixed round-robin order. You could also randomize the choice of next server to be less predictable. Or implement logic to skip a server that is down (e.g., wrap the connect attempt in a try/except and move to the next if it fails). These improvements make the system more robust if one of user's free-tier servers goes offline or hits a limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** When switching VPN connections, there will be a brief interruption in connectivity. Ensure that the disconnect of one and connect to the next happens smoothly. In the script above, we disconnect then immediately connect the next – this assumes the commands execute quickly. In practice, one might insert a short delay (`time.sleep(1)`) to give the network a moment to re-route. Also, if a request is mid-flight during a switch, it could fail, so it’s wise to only switch between requests (as we do by counting after a completed request). If integrating with an ongoing process, ensure the rotation doesn’t occur in the middle of an important transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Monitoring and Logging the Rotation System ##\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep track of what’s happening and ensure the system works properly, implement **logging and monitoring** both in the Python controller and on the servers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logging in the Python Script:** Use Python’s `logging` module or simple print statements to record events. At minimum, log whenever the IP rotates. For example: “Switched from VPN A (US) to VPN B (EU) at 2025-04-02 10:00:00, after 100 requests.” Also log the new external IP (as retrieved from a service like ifconfig or ipify). We can also log each request URL or response status if that’s relevant to one's testing. Writing these logs to a file (e.g. `rotation.log`) will help you review the history later. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import logging\n",
    "  logging.basicConfig(filename=\"rotation.log\", level=logging.INFO,\n",
    "                      format=\"%(asctime)s %(message)s\")\n",
    "  # ... in the rotation code ...\n",
    "  logging.info(f\"Rotating VPN. Disconnecting {vpn_configs[current_index]} after {max_requests} requests.\")\n",
    "  logging.info(f\"Connected to new VPN {vpn_configs[current_index]} with IP {my_ip}\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Monitoring VPN Connectivity:** It’s useful to verify that the VPN tunnel is actually up and one's traffic is going through it:\n",
    "  - After connecting to each VPN, the script can make a test request to a known reliable site (like `https://api.ipify.org` or `http://ifconfig.me`) to fetch the IP and confirm it’s the expected one from that region. If not, log an error or try reconnecting.\n",
    "  - User could also ping a server (e.g. 8.8.8.8) through the VPN to check latency/packet loss. If you detect the VPN is down (requests failing or no response), the script could attempt to reconnect or switch to the next server early.\n",
    "  - Consider adding a try/except around the `requests.get` calls as shown. If a request times out or fails due to network, the script might decide the current VPN is having issues and trigger a rotation immediately (instead of waiting for 100). This makes the system more resilient.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Server-side Monitoring:** On each VPN server (the cloud VMs), one can enable logging for the VPN service:\n",
    "  - WireGuard doesn’t log each connection by default, but you can check its status by running `sudo wg` to see if a peer is connected and when last handshake was. You might script a periodic `wg` or check system logs for any errors.\n",
    "  - OpenVPN servers can be set to verb 3 logging to see connections. User might not need to actively monitor these logs unless debugging a connection issue.\n",
    "  - Ensure each server has metrics on bandwidth usage (cloud providers often show network usage per instance). This helps ensure user stay within free-tier limits and also confirms traffic is flowing as expected. For example, Oracle Cloud’s dashboard will show you how much data your free VM has used (remember Oracle allows 10 TB, so likely not an issue ([GitHub - cloudcommunity/Cloud-Free-Tier-Comparison: Comparing the free tier offers of the major cloud providers like AWS, Azure, GCP, Oracle etc.](https://github.com/cloudcommunity/Cloud-Free-Tier-Comparison#:~:text=%2A%204%20Arm,5%20OCI%20Bastions)); GCP and AWS have stricter egress limits to watch ([GitHub - cloudcommunity/Cloud-Free-Tier-Comparison: Comparing the free tier offers of the major cloud providers like AWS, Azure, GCP, Oracle etc.](https://github.com/cloudcommunity/Cloud-Free-Tier-Comparison#:~:text=,east1))).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **System Resource Monitoring:** Since we are using micro instances, keep an eye on CPU and memory usage:\n",
    "  - WireGuard is very lightweight and should use minimal CPU/RAM, even on a 1GB VM. OpenVPN might use a bit more CPU for encryption, but for moderate traffic it should be fine. Still, you can use `htop` or cloud monitoring to ensure your instance isn’t swapping or maxed out.\n",
    "  - If a server runs out of memory or crashes, one's VPN would go down. Logging on the client side will show requests failing, and one would know to possibly skip that server or investigate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rotation Count Reset and Tracking:** Each time user rotates, the counter resets. One might also want to track the total number of requests made or rotations done in a session. Logging “Completed rotation #5, switched to IP X” gives a sense of progress if user ran a long test.\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing these logging and monitoring practices, create a feedback loop to learn from the system’s behavior. One can observe how quickly 100 requests occur, how the latency differs when connected to different region servers, and how the system responds.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Keeping It Fun, Low-Cost, and Educational ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, some tips and suggestions to maintain a **fun, low-cost, learning-focused** project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stay Within Free Limits:** Always double-check the free-tier quotas to avoid unwanted charges. For AWS, remember the 12-month limit – after that, the instance isn’t free. Either migrate to another free tier or shut it down before the year ends. For always-free services like Oracle’s, ensure usage (CPU hours, bandwidth) stays within the free allowance (which is quite generous). Monitoring usage, as mentioned, will help with this ([Setup a Free VPN Service on AWS with OpenVPN | Analytics Vidhya](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/setup-a-free-vpn-service-on-aws-613fcec6e7c6#:~:text=,running%20the%20VPN%20on%20AWS)) ([GitHub - cloudcommunity/Cloud-Free-Tier-Comparison: Comparing the free tier offers of the major cloud providers like AWS, Azure, GCP, Oracle etc.](https://github.com/cloudcommunity/Cloud-Free-Tier-Comparison#:~:text=%2A%204%20Arm,5%20OCI%20Bastions)).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Experiment with Different VPN Software:** Part of the learning could be to try all three options (OpenVPN, WireGuard, SoftEther) and see differences:\n",
    "  - Set up one server with WireGuard and another with OpenVPN, and maybe a third with SoftEther. User can then adjust your client to connect to each and observe performance or ease of connection. For instance, WireGuard might give better throughput and lower latency due to its lightweight design.\n",
    "  - SoftEther would allow you to connect using different protocols (it can generate an OpenVPN config or allow L2TP/IPsec connections) – one could try connecting from a mobile device using L2TP to your SoftEther server for fun.\n",
    "  - This multi-software approach is educational but not necessary for rotation; user can stick to one type for consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Geo-testing and Fun Use-Cases:** Since we assume IPs in various countries, user can use this setup to test geo-restricted services or see localized content:\n",
    "  - After connecting to the Japan VPN, try visiting a site and see if it shows Japanese content by default.\n",
    "  - Use the EU IP to test GDPR notice behaviors on websites.\n",
    "  - This can make the learning more tangible (just be mindful of each provider’s terms of service regarding running VPNs – generally it’s fine for personal use).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automate Cloud Instance Management (Advanced):** If user wanted to extend the project, one could use Python (with cloud SDKs or Terraform) to automate bringing up and down these free-tier instances:\n",
    "  - For example, use AWS CLI (boto3 in Python) to start/stop instances on schedule to stay within hours, or to swap AMIs.\n",
    "  - However, free-tier instances are usually running continuously. Automation here might be more relevant if one needed to tear down and recreate to change IP (for instance, if you wanted a *new* IP each time, you could programmatically allocate a new VM or new Elastic IP – this is more complex and may hit account limits).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Security Considerations:** Even for a fun project, remember basic security:\n",
    "  - Use **strong keys/passwords** for your VPN servers. For WireGuard, the keys are random and strong by default. For OpenVPN, use at least 2048-bit RSA or better for certificates.\n",
    "  - Keep the VPN server software updated (apply security patches on those VMs periodically).\n",
    "  - Only allow your IP or a small range to SSH into the servers, to reduce exposure.\n",
    "  - Because this is self-hosted, **user controls the logs** – by default our WireGuard setup doesn’t log traffic and OpenVPN can be configured not to keep logs, so one's privacy is in one's hands. Just remember your cloud provider still knows your VM’s public IP and could see bandwidth usage; it’s not completely anonymous like a no-log VPN provider might claim, but for personal use it’s fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cost Awareness:** Everything here is designed to be free-tier, but always have a mental checklist:\n",
    "  - AWS free tier ends after 12 months – set a reminder to avoid charges later.\n",
    "  - Oracle free is forever but if upgraded the account or add resources beyond the free ones, those incur costs.\n",
    "  - If one uses trial credits (Azure, DO, etc.), keep track of expiry.\n",
    "  - Avoid using services not in free tier (e.g. if you accidentally choose a larger VM instance type, it won’t be free).\n",
    "  - If unsure, user can put spending limits or alerts on these accounts. AWS has free-tier usage alarms ([Overstating AWS's Free Tier Generosity - Last Week in AWS Blog](https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/overstating-awss-free-tier-generosity/#:~:text=Overstating%20AWS%27s%20Free%20Tier%20Generosity,across%20all%20regions%20in%20perpetuity)), GCP and Azure have budgets/alerts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enjoy the Learning Process:** This project touches many domains: cloud computing, network administration, cybersecurity (VPN encryption), and programming. Take the time to explore each:\n",
    "  - In the cloud console, observe the network routes and security groups created.\n",
    "  - On the VPN servers, use tools like `tcpdump` to see VPN packets encapsulated, or see how NAT is working.\n",
    "  - Adjust the Python script to handle edge cases, or even integrate asynchronous requests (if using `aiohttp`, for example, to fire many requests in parallel and still count them).\n",
    "  - Perhaps integrate a **failover mechanism**: if one region is slow or fails, automatically switch to another (this introduces you to more complex state management).\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps and suggestions, user will have a **self-hosted VPN rotation system** that cycles through IP addresses from various free-world regions, all at little to no cost. You avoid any paid proxy or VPN rotation service by leveraging free cloud resources and a bit of coding. This setup can be used for safe web scraping (honoring target sites’ policies), testing how apps behave under changing IPs, or just learning about VPNs and networks. And because it’s all under one's control, we can tweak and expand it however wezs like. **Happy experimenting!**\n",
